            <h3>üå± Planting</h3>
            <p>
              Select a location with well-drained, loamy soil and partial shade. Plant healthy 
              cuttings or seedlings about 1 meter apart to allow for proper growth and airflow.
              Mulch around the base to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

            <h3>üíß Watering</h3>
            <p>
              Maintain consistent soil moisture, watering 2‚Äì3 times per week in dry periods. 
              Avoid waterlogging as it can cause root rot. During the rainy season, monitor 
              drainage to prevent excess water accumulation.

            <h3>üåø Fertilization</h3>
            <p>
              Apply well-decomposed organic compost every 3 months to provide essential nutrients.
              Use a balanced NPK fertilizer twice a year to encourage strong growth and improve 
              bark quality. Consider foliar feeding during dry periods to supplement micronutrients.

            <h3>ü™¥ Pruning & Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
              Regularly prune the plants to remove dead branches and promote healthy growth. 
              Thin the canopy to allow sunlight penetration and improve air circulation. 
              Keep the plantation free of weeds and monitor for pests like aphids and scale insects.

            <h3>‚è≥ Harvesting</h3>
            <p>
              Harvest cinnamon bark 2‚Äì3 years after planting by carefully cutting mature stems. 
              For premium quality, select 5‚Äì6-year-old stems. After harvesting, peel the bark 
              and dry it in a shaded, well-ventilated area to preserve flavor and aroma.
